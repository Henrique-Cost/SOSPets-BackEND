# SOSPets-BackEND

Completion work of my technical computer course. Started at FIEC (Indaiatuba), 
SOS Pets is a project where users can post their lost domestic animals by placing specific data on the animal and performing a search in the database, 
the user can post a publication and looking for their animal so that others can find it. can also search, just as a person who found an animal 
can put it in the APP its data and address close to where he found it and thus saving it in our database. We use Java (with Spring as Framework).
